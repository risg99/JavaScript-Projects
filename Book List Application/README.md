### Project 4: [Book List Application](#https://github.com/risg99/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/Book%20List%20Application)

<p align="justify">
Book List Application enables the user to a new book with the title, author name and ISBN(a unique number). The user can delete a book from the list, which also gets deleted from the Local Storage as the book list is also persisted to the local storage. So, upon refreshing only the books present in Local Storage will be visible in the table(list) in the application. This repository contains two app.js files: one(appes5.js) uses the ES5 JS classes and the second(appes6.js) uses the ES6 JS Classes. The objective of this application was to understand the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript.
