### Project 8: [Profile Scroller Application](#https://github.com/risg99/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/Profile%20Scroller%20Application)

Profile Scroller Application is a small one-paged application like dating websites Tinder and BumbleBee to implement the concept of Iterators in JavaScript.

On the User Interface, as soon as a user clicks Next, the next item of the iterator object is displayed.
