# JavaScript-Projects

This directory contains some JavaScript Projects that will help to clear the basics and foundations.

### Project 1: [Task List Application](#https://github.com/risg99/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/Task%20List%20Application)

<p align="justify">
Task List Application has the features to add, delete and filter tasks from task list. The application enables the user to add a single or multiple tasks to the task list. The cross button ensures the task selected is deleted. It also has a clear all tasks button, that deletes all the tasks. An additional functionality of filtering through the tasks is also available. It is crucial to mention that addition and deletion of task is connection to the Local Storage of the Browser. That means once the task is added, it persists to the local storage and when deleted, gets deleted from the Local Storage as well. <br> Have a look at the complete application demo below:

Number Guesser Application enables the user to guess a number between a minimum and maximum value. It obeys the following rules:
  
  1. Players must guess a number between a min and max 
  
  2. Player gets a certain amount of guesses
  
  3. Notify the player of remaining number of guesses

  4. Notify the player of the correct answer if looses

  5. Let player choose to play again

### Project 4: [Book List Application](#https://github.com/risg99/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/Book%20List%20Application)

<p align="justify">
Book List Application enables the user to a new book with the title, author name and ISBN(a unique number). The user can delete a book from the list, which also gets deleted from the Local Storage as the book list is also persisted to the local storage. So, upon refreshing only the books present in Local Storage will be visible in the table(list) in the application. This repository contains two app.js files: one(appes5.js) uses the ES5 JS classes and the second(appes6.js) uses the ES6 JS Classes. The objective of this application was to understand the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript.
