### Project 6: [User Form Validation](#https://github.com/risg99/JavaScript-Projects/tree/main/User%20Form)

<p align="justify">
User Form Validation is a simple form page that inputs user details of Name, Email-id, Zipcode and PhoneNumber with each of the fields having some restrictions. The form validation was an implementation of regular expressions in JavaScript. 
  
<ul> 
  <li> Name can contain 2-10 alphabets.</li>
  
  <li> Zipcode contains 6 digits with a dash like xxx-xxx.</li>
  
  <li> Email id contains alphabets, digits or special symbols like underscore, period and dash, followed by @ and another set of alphabets, digits or special symbols, which is followed by a period and then again with 2-5 alphabets. </li>
  
  <li> Phone Number can be entered in a range of 10 digits in the format of xxx-xxx-xxxx with either spaces, dashes or periods in between the groups of digits.</li>
</ul>
If the user enters details that don't satisfy the requirements, an alert message is shown.
