<p align="justify">
Number Guesser Application enables the user to guess a number between a minimum and maximum value. It obeys the following rules:
  
  1. Players must guess a number between a min and max 
  
  2. Player gets a certain amount of guesses
  
  3. Notify the player of remaining number of guesses

  4. Notify the player of the correct answer if looses

  5. Let player choose to play again


In this application, the minimum is set to 1 and maximum to 20. The number of guesses(trials) available are 3. The player gets the chance to play again, if he won or he looses(after completion of 3 guesses).
